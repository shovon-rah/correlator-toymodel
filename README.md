This project simulates synthetic two-point correlation functions (inspired by lattice QCD hadron correlators), adds short-range AR(1) correlated noise, and analyzes the uncertainties using three common resampling techniques:

- Jackknife
- Bootstrap (with variable sample sizes)
- Blocking resampling (with variable block sizes)

Plots, uncertainty ratio comparisons, and insights into the behavior of resampling techniques under correlation are included.
